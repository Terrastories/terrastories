## About Terrastories

**Terrastories** is an open-source geostorytelling application for mapping, managing and sharing place-based stories. The application is being co-created with Indigenous and other local communities to collectively manage their oral histories and other cultural knowledge, but it can be used by anyone to create a map of their stories.

Terrastories is a Dockerized Rails and React app that uses [**Mapbox GL JS**](https://mapbox.com) / [**MapLibre GL JS**](https://maplibre.com/) to help users locate place-based media content or narrative stories on an interactive map. As a local-first application, Terrastories is designed to work entirely offline, so that remote communities can access the application entirely without needing internet connectivity.

The Terrastories interface is principally composed of an interactive map and a sidebar with media content. Users can explore the map and click on activated points to see the stories associated with those points. Alternatively, users can interact with the sidebar and click on stories to see where in the landscape these narratives took place. 

By means of a content management system, users with the right level of access can also explore, add, edit, remove, and import stories, or set them as restricted so that they are viewable only with a special login. Users can design and customize the content of the interactive map entirely.

Learn more about Terrastories on [our website](https://terrastories.app/).

## Install Terrastories

Terrastories can be set up for different hosting environments, including online, local (development), mesh network, or offline "field kit". For local or offline hosting, there is a convenience script that walks you through all of the steps, or you can choose to follow the more granular guides for the various environments and operating systems.

### Prerequisites

#### Docker
Local development and offline mode both require Docker to be installed.

Download and install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) for your platform.

> NOTE: Windows requires WSL 2.0 or virtualization in order to work. Additionally, it is possible that you may need to configure some additional settings for Terrastories to properly work on Windows.

#### Tileserver (Offline "Field Kit" Mode)

If you plan on running Terrastories offline, you'll need to configure local tiles for offline use.

A default, open-license map for using offline with Terrastories is available at https://github.com/terrastories/default-offline/tiles. You will have the option of downloading these using the setup script below. Alternatively, you can manually download these files and place them in the `tileserver/data` directory, and they should work when you load Terrastories in Field Kit mode.

### Setup

1. Clone this repository
1. Run
   ```sh
   $ ./bin/setup
   ```
   and follow the prompts.

Once you have set up Terrastories, you can log in to the super admin console, or the sample Terrastories community, using login information found in `rails/db/seeds.rb`.

If you are developing with an online (Mapbox) map, you will need to provide an access token. Copy the contents of the `.env.example` file into a newly created file called `.env` (Do not change .env.example!). In the `.env` file, replace where it says `pk.set-your-key-here` (after `DEFAULT_MAPBOX_TOKEN=`) with your mapbox access token. 

### Issues?

Review more granular setup options in the [Setup](documentation/SETUP.md) documentation.
